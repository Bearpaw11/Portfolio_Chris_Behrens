# Portfolio_Chris_Behrens
This is a portfolio page I made to showcase my current knowledge and skill set.

This was built using React.
React-Router-DOM was used for the routing of the page.
CSS and React Bootstrap were used for the styling.
Also, used a NPM package called React-Slick for the carousel on the portfolio page.

This page is deployed @ chrisbehrensportfolio.netlify.app/
